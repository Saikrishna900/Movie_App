Project Title: Movie App with Title, Rating, Overview, and Images using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Project Description:

The Movie App is a popular web application that allows users to search for movies and view detailed information about them, such as the title, rating, overview, and images. In this project, we will create a simple but functional Movie App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The Movie App will have the following features:

    Search Functionality: The user can search for a movie by entering a keyword or phrase in the search bar.

    Movie Display: The Movie App will display a list of movies that match the search criteria, including the movie title, rating, overview, and images.

    Movie Details: When the user clicks on a movie, the Movie App will display detailed information about the movie, including the title, rating, overview, and images.

    Responsive Design: The Movie App will be designed with a responsive layout, ensuring that it looks great and functions well on different screen sizes, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.

The implementation of this project will involve the following steps:

    Creating a basic HTML structure for the Movie App, including the search bar, movie list, and movie details.

    Styling the HTML elements using CSS, including the layout, fonts, colors, and effects.

    Implementing the JavaScript logic for searching movies, displaying movie lists and details, and loading movie images.

    Integrating with an API: To obtain movie data, we will integrate the Movie App with a popular API like TMDB, which provides access to a vast collection of movies and related information.

    Testing and debugging the Movie App to ensure that it works as expected.

Overall, the Movie App project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is an excellent opportunity to enhance your web development skills and create a useful and engaging application for movie enthusiasts.
